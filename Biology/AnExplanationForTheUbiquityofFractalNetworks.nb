Klieber\[CloseCurlyQuote]s law showed that as you increase the size of an \
organism, you increase the metabolism of the organism by a 3/4 power. This \
went unexplained for many years, until Geoffrey West proposed that the effect \
was a result of the similarity in shape of energy networks found in all \
animals.  Namely, that the most efficient way to get energy to all the cells \
in the body, was with a fractal network, and therefore all the animals \
converged to this solution. In this sense, an elephant is just a mouse but \
with a larger fractal network. From the mathematical properties of these \
networks, the quarter power scaling laws that Klieber found, naturally arise. \
To give you an example, (enter example about quarter power scaling with \
circulatory system). \

One of the assumptions of West\[CloseCurlyQuote]s model is what he calls \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]invariant terminal units\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]. For \
the scaling laws to emerge, the cells of the organism, or the leaves of the \
plant, or the size of the household, must be about the same size. One \
question that West does not explore, is why these invariant terminal units \
are so common? In other words, why aren\[CloseCurlyQuote]t humans made out of \
cells of different sizes? You could give the biochemical reason, that cells \
can\[CloseCurlyQuote]t get any bigger. But that doesn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t \
explain why some of them aren\[CloseCurlyQuote]t smaller. And I\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]m sure some of them are smaller and bigger. But if you \
could take a microscope and just move it around in the human body, most of \
the cells look about the same. Why is that? \

My idea is that this these invariant terminal units naturally arise out of \
the volatility in speed of evolutionary processes. What my explorations into \
the world of biology, both computational and empirical, is that large changes \
in the speed of evolution can happen. These \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]windows of \
opportunity\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] naturally lead to winner-take-all \
effects, which leads to a lot of similarity between terminal units. X Billion \
years ago an opportunity opened up for a self-reproducing molecule to be \
formed, DNA was formed. This created an opportunity for bacteria to evolve \
and spread all across the globe. Bacteria, being energy consuming, destroyed \
any other molecule with a chance to become self-reproducing. This would \
explain the ubiquity of DNA we see on earth. Some X hundred millions years \
later, a new opportunity formed for multicellular organisms, animalia, \
plantae and fungi were formed, and destroyed any other potential candidates \
that were slightly behind. You can think of this like a river, where we \
assume there is great variation in the width of the river, in a squeeze only \
a few organisms make it, and then when the river gets wider and more full of \
resources those few organisms dominate.  \

This happened again with humans, where the widening of the river allowed many \
similar ideas for human-like organisms to emerge with austrealia pithcicus \
and neanderthals, but the river squeezed in, and for whatever reason, be it \
mixing, or extinction, one idea one out. As I\[CloseCurlyQuote]m writing this \
I\[CloseCurlyQuote]m realizing that a distinction must be made between a \
resource constraint and simply one idea being better than the others. \

What this pattern leads inevitably leads to is winner-take-all effects and \
thus with each squeeze we are left with only a few options as building blocks \
for larger systems. The bacteria won out, being the only option for larger \
cells to form from, then a few types of larger cells won out, becoming the \
building blocks for multicellular organisms, then humans won out, becoming \
the building blocks for civilizations, and eventually companies, cities and \

As I\[CloseCurlyQuote]m writing this, I\[CloseCurlyQuote]m thinking about \
another potential reason for this that seems to make a bit more sense, which \
is more of a constraint on the ability of adaptive processes to find optimal \
solutions, maybe the the most natural solution is just to keep a bunch of the \
same units that \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]get the job done\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] and just adapt them slightly for your needs. It\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]s much easier just to copy the same cell and then just \
tweak it, then design from the bottom up every single time. Yea that\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]s good. But regardless, it still connects.\

Anyways the prediction of this model that I\[CloseCurlyQuote]m laying out, is \
that we should observe these quarter-power scaling laws, on other planets and \
in other domains. I think West does a good job of covering his basis in human \
culture, one thing I\[CloseCurlyQuote]m thinking about, is applying this idea \
to software design. So the SQL read writes would be the terminal units and \
the flow of information through the different parts of the application would \
be the fractal network. \
