Similarly and somewhat counterintuitively, I\[CloseCurlyQuote]d expect that \
our understanding of diseases that are more lethal has progressed faster than \
that of milder diseases, because in the case of a lethal diagnosis, the \
physician has more freedom to do trial and error, because there is no fear of \
making things worse. [[need examples]] \

Cell["\<\
To combat these issues, biologists often resort to model organisms, which \
have faster speeds of iteration and less risk. And this creates another thing \
we\[CloseCurlyQuote]d expect to observe, which is that, the aspects of humans \
that are different from other organisms, will be less well understood. [[need \
examples]]\

But I think one of the things that our recent work in biology makes clear, is \
that biological systems are full of irreducibility, and therefore it is \
sometimes not possible to \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]jump ahead\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] with a more sophisticated computational process in \
order to predict their behavior. \

Cell["\<\
In the case of medicine, this means that no matter how \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]intelligent\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] the \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]medical observer\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] is, in some \
cases, there is no way to predict which treatment will be effective, without \
just trying it. \

Cell["\<\
And what becomes obvious in such cases, is that the rate of medical progress, \
will be determined not by our intelligence, but our speed of iteration. In \
other words, how fast we can apply the treatment, and how fast we can tell \
whether it\[CloseCurlyQuote]s worked.  \

Cell["\<\
And in fact, surveying the different areas of medicine, iteration speed is \
strongly correlated with the rate of progress. Areas like longevity and limb \
regeneration take years before we can accurately determine the outcome of a \
given treatment, and therefore, progress is slow. In contrast, with \
infections and certain cancers, it is clear quite soon whether the treatment \
was successful. \

But okay, we\[CloseCurlyQuote]ve made this general statement that biology is \
full of irreducible systems. But can we be more specific, can we tell when \
and where we\[CloseCurlyQuote]d most expect to see this irreducibility?\

Well, we can look at our model, and see the conditions for which reducibility \
and irreducibility arrive. [[give origin of structure spiel]]\

Over the past few months, I\[CloseCurlyQuote]ve worked intensely with Stephen \
Wolfram on building new foundational models for theoretical biology using a \
minimal computational model. And because these computational models can be \
readily manipulated and visualized, they are much more accessible than the \
traditional mathematical models. And, in working with them, I\
