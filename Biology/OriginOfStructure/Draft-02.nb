What is the nature of biological processes. How do they look? What can they \

In my experience, modern academic institutions are really bad at answering \

So okay these are bold statements, who do I think I am, right? Well, I think \
most biologists have largely missed a powerful new class of models: those \
based on simple computational rules. And because of this, they have been \
limited in their ability to give a good high-level description of what is \
going on in biology. In the past year or so, Stephen Wolfram has filled this \
gap and pioneered some groundbreaking computational models for biological \
systems. Starting as a fan of the research, and eventually becoming a \
collaborator, I\[CloseCurlyQuote]ve become convinced that \
we\[CloseCurlyQuote]ve struck gold and are now in a position to understand \
the high-level features of biology better than ever before. \

Again, these are big statements. So let\[CloseCurlyQuote]s get more specific. \
What are our models and what claims can we make from them?\

Cell["\<\
To model an \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]organism\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] we use \
what\[CloseCurlyQuote]s called a cellular automaton, which is just a set of \
updating rules, applied recursively. The rules are shown here on the right, \
and the result of running those rules, starting from a single red cell, is \
shown on the left. \
\>", "Text",ExpressionUUID->"0bbd7648-9833-43ba-ae1b-ddab09da1d10"],

Cell["\<\
But this isn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t just a random cellular automaton. We reached \
this pattern through an \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]evolution\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote], where we repeatedly made random, single-bit changes \
to the set of rules, keeping only the changes that lead to a pattern with a \
longer or equal finite length, as in:\

Cell["\<\
So the \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]goal\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] of our organisms \
is to \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]live\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] as many steps as \
possible and then terminate. And the rules determine how the organism \
achieves this goal. \
\>", "Text",ExpressionUUID->"ed3ab783-4c25-47d8-99cc-3521b9e4595a"],

Cell["\<\
The similarities are already striking between this and biological evolution. \
For example, we can run multiple evolutions and see different potential \
evolutionary paths:\
\>", "Text",ExpressionUUID->"2e502f19-e8e5-49e5-ba5d-65f82c5d673e"],

Cell["\<\
And looking just at the progressive fitness in our evolutions, we can see how \
the organisms \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]climb\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] different \
fitness hills and then plateau at some point, similar to what\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]s observed in biology.\
\>", "Text",ExpressionUUID->"85fe8e92-fce2-4fff-8019-feef17aa0185"],

Cell["\<\
But what I want to discuss here is the nature of the observed patterns. How \
do these sets of rules achieve their goal of living some number of steps and \
then terminating? \
\>", "Text",ExpressionUUID->"8a06fd6a-bb3f-4186-bf63-0847b1a2f48e"],

Cell["\<\
To get at this, we can look at an adaptively evolved set of organisms:\
\>", "Text",ExpressionUUID->"80b0ebfc-639a-4af2-aced-f0412e36ffcc"],

Cell["And compare that to a random sample of our rule space: ", "Text",ExpressionUUID->"e209ec9a-f028-4269-a08c-a75c8556ce29"],

Cell["\<\
And from this, we can see that the main problem that adaptive evolution is \
solving in this case is growth inhibition. And because of that, our evolved \
organisms exhibit much more of a \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]worm-like\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] shape then the random group. \
\>", "Text",ExpressionUUID->"f747f911-a72e-4b14-bbcb-4fa28b8289ef"],

Cell["\<\
So this is a high-level pocket of reducibility, and if a biologist were \
looking at this, he could indeed form some theory about the shape of \
organisms. But what about more low-level mechanisms, like say the different \
rule frequencies of the random group and the adaptive group:\
\>", "Text",ExpressionUUID->"c30e77be-c479-43c9-aa4a-1c7c727a0abe"],

Cell["\<\
So each bar corresponds to the number of automaton in the group that had that \
rule.\
\>", "Text",ExpressionUUID->"6f98e279-bcfa-4473-bdd8-10bd257cbaa3"],

Cell["And here is data from 10 random groups:", "Text",ExpressionUUID->"fd40e66c-744b-407d-b13f-fc965557cfe2"],

Cell["\<\
So clearly, there is some statistically significant difference here. And \
based on our conclusion that the evolved automata are better at growth \
inhibition, we can look at \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]edge-rules\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] or rules with two white squares. These rules, \
highlighted here, are critical for growth inhibition and \
we\[CloseCurlyQuote]d expect the adapted group to have far more white square \
outputs for these rules.\
\>", "Text",ExpressionUUID->"e8daba1d-4467-4a46-beb9-f7af4d6abca5"],

Cell["\<\
Looking at the frequencies of the \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]growth-inhibiting\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] rules we can see that they are indeed \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]active\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] much more frequently in \
the adaptive group. So this would correspond to a low-level theory that we \
could form about our organisms, similar to how a molecular biologists could \
find certain genes and proteins that are associated with certain behaviors. \
But the key point, is that only some of these rules in our automata actually \
have a \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]function\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] that you can \
map to the behavior. For many of the \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]inner-rules\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] their use isn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t so clear. \
\>", "Text",ExpressionUUID->"a4c2798c-f742-49cc-80d0-29b24f1f454b"],

Cell["\<\
And the reason is because our fitness-function is not acting heavily on the \
inner rules. In other words, there are many different ways to grow, and so \
the ones evolution finds are not necessarily explainable. But you may be \
wondering, can we make our fitness function more restrictive, and force the \
irreducibility out of the system? \
\>", "Text",ExpressionUUID->"e98f6e0a-33d1-4007-9ac5-f193f97169e2"],

Cell["\<\
Well, one common theme in biology is dealing with noise in the environment, \
and still being able to function. So we can do our same evolution, but make \
perturbations to the automaton as it grows, and take the minimum length from \
all the perturbed automaton. Then, we try to increase that minimum length. \
\>", "Text",ExpressionUUID->"5921dd54-f9c7-4345-9202-99e480155f78"],

Cell["\<\
And the results are very nice. Because what we get are far \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]simpler\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] organisms that use \
more explainable mechanisms. \
\>", "Text",ExpressionUUID->"56a6acf4-d303-4789-b401-efc0df6df834"],

Cell["\<\
So the solution that is often found is to have some pattern that ends \
despite, many of the details of the internal subpatterns:\
\>", "Text",ExpressionUUID->"1d1ecc06-265b-4f3b-bfb6-2132df310e5c"],

Cell["\<\
And what we\[CloseCurlyQuote]ve touched on here is an important law of \
biology an adaptive systems, which is the more noise in the environment the \
more simple and explainable the underlying mechanisms end up being. As an \
example, animals like frogs, who are hatched from eggs in the wild, we would \
expect to have far more explainable mechanisms for how their morphogenesis \
works. But mammals who are grown mostly from the safety of the womb, wouldn\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]t have to deal with as much noise. So, I suspect that the \
embryogenesis process, especially the early stage, is far more irreducible \
and specific then something like a frog. And therefore if you mix up a human \
embryo, you\[CloseCurlyQuote]d get a completely different structure, as \
opposed to a frog / planeria embryo, who can handle these perturbations.\
\>", "Text",ExpressionUUID->"2695d2b2-20de-4644-bd7d-c410b831bdfe"],

Cell["\<\
And in terms of explainability, it is known that planeria use a general \
sorting network to complete morphogenesis, and so you can perturb the system \
in the right way and get a two-headed flatworm. This would definitely not be \
possible I believe in the mammalian case.\
\>", "Text",ExpressionUUID->"c5988d9a-81e3-471b-a165-dadd93b3b082"],

Cell["\<\
So okay, but just how reducible are these highly-robust guys? Well as we can \
see, they still have pieces of irreducibility and are not perfectly robust. \
And this is the consequence of the physical limitations of the cellular \
automaton system here, as well as the limitations of our adaptive search. \
\>", "Text",ExpressionUUID->"2f520cdc-a233-4858-9f55-9480e39910de"],

Cell["\<\
And because of this, if we take these guys outside of their noise tolerance \
level, outside of their evolved track, what we get is irreducible behavior. \
And the fundamental problem of medicine is then trying to get these guys back \
on track. \
\>", "Text",ExpressionUUID->"e4d5ccc7-80f5-41d1-864e-c198175813ff"],

Cell["\<\
And so what has happened in most diseases, is something has happened to the \
evolved guard rails of irreducibility. But the implication is that quite \
often you can steal ideas from biology, and just apply them in a new way:\
\>", "Text",ExpressionUUID->"cf7c98f3-b7e1-4cb6-9adb-6859964684af"],

Cell["\<\
But even this still has irreducibility in it, and is computationally and \
therefore economically expensive.\
\>", "Text",ExpressionUUID->"0a0050c0-4b6b-4f43-948e-5001c1435ce7"],

Cell["\<\
We should pause here to look at some actual medicine data. And what we see is \
that actually most of the diseases are self-inflicted! And then we spend all \
this computational effort to try to pick up the pieces. So our model would \
suggest that we should focus on simply not throwing ourselves off the cliffs \
of irreducibility. \
\>", "Text",ExpressionUUID->"cdbc2af3-082f-4519-94b5-0c67e772b6f3"],

Cell["\<\
What we\[CloseCurlyQuote]re doing is the equivalent of the following: We have \
an evolved track that we can walk down the mountain. But instead we just jump \
off the cliff and then spend a bunch of money and time trying to building \
parachutes as we fall down. \

So we\[CloseCurlyQuote]ve mostly talked about avoidance of diseases, but what \
about increased performance. How can we get these automaton to do their job \
even better? \
