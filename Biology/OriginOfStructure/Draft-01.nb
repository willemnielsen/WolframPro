Cell["\<\
So okay these are bold statements, who do I think I am, right? Well, I think \
most biologists have largely missed the powerful new paradigm of using \
computation as opposed to mathematics for their models. And because of this, \
they have been limited in their ability to give a good high-level description \
of what is going on in biology. Stephen Wolfram has recently pioneered some \
groundbreaking computational models for biology. Starting as a fan of the \
research, and eventually becoming a collaborator, I\[CloseCurlyQuote]ve \
become convinced that we\[CloseCurlyQuote]ve struck gold and that with these \
models, we\[CloseCurlyQuote]re now in a position to understand the high-level \
features of biology better than anyone ever has before. \

Looking more closely at the specific patterns, we have these subpatterns that \
work together to achieve a particular goal. And the implication is that \
adaptive processes like evolution are \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]mining \

Cell["\<\
In other words, with each improvement step, they\[CloseCurlyQuote]re finding \
irreducible subprograms that increase their finite length. And as a result, \
it\[CloseCurlyQuote]s clear that certain parts of our organism are just \
completely unexplainable, and trying to come up with a reason for why they \
exist, is like trying to jump ahead of an irreducible process. \
\>", "Text",ExpressionUUID->"cabe0cda-2316-40a0-8ead-20669c683341"],

Cell["\<\
But just how much reducibility and irreducibility are in these patterns. \
Given the fact that we are selecting for a particular feature (finite \
length), you\[CloseCurlyQuote]d expect that there is at least some \
commonalities between the organisms.\
\>", "Text",ExpressionUUID->"5e94b9b6-e6f8-4f5d-9fc1-a19d998b9e89"],

Cell["\<\
To get at this, we can look at an adaptively evolved set of organisms:\
\>", "Text",ExpressionUUID->"ba4f356f-2ea7-4a24-ace3-16672c75b169"],

Cell["And compare that to a random sample of our rule space: ", "Text",ExpressionUUID->"f3ba0baf-af76-4378-b452-3c3ae2246565"],

Cell["\<\
And from this, we can see that the main problem that adaptive evolution is \
solving in this case is growth inhibition. And because of that, our evolved \
organisms exhibit much more of a \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]worm-like\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] shape then the random group. \
\>", "Text",ExpressionUUID->"12f242db-615a-4875-aae3-0693d57d5866"],

Cell["\<\
So this is a high-level pocket of reducibility, and if a biologist were \
looking at this, he could indeed form some theory about the shape of \
organisms. But what about more low-level mechanisms, like say the different \
rule frequencies of the random group and the adaptive group:\
\>", "Text",ExpressionUUID->"f2238ad2-0b06-4508-9410-c3bab4386464"],

Cell["\<\
So each bar corresponds to the number of automaton in the group that had that \
rule.\
\>", "Text",ExpressionUUID->"482e4ee3-32b4-4351-8f38-576d5af47258"],

Cell["And here is data from 10 random groups:", "Text",ExpressionUUID->"449e4eea-b3a7-4ad6-81e3-2acbf35494ff"],

Cell["\<\
So clearly, there is some statistically significant difference here. And \
based on our conclusion that the evolved automata are better at growth \
inhibition, we can look at \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]edge-rules\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] or rules with two white squares. These rules, \
highlighted here, are critical for growth inhibition and \
we\[CloseCurlyQuote]d expect the adapted group to have far more white square \
outputs for these rules.\
\>", "Text",ExpressionUUID->"27b8491d-6ba9-4302-8057-aa6a1fe5c460"],

Cell["\<\
Looking at the frequencies of the \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]growth-inhibiting\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] rules we can see that they are indeed \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]active\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] much more frequently in \
the adaptive group. So this would correspond to a low-level theory that we \
could form about our organisms, similar to how a molecular biologists could \
find certain genes and proteins that are associated with certain behaviors. \
But the key point, is that only some of these rules in our automata actually \
have a \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]function\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] that you can \
map to the behavior. For many of the \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]inner-rules\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] their use isn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t so clear. \
\>", "Text",ExpressionUUID->"e649a5c4-76b4-4913-96bb-98bb8bb7cf40"],

Cell["\<\
And the reason is because our fitness-function is not acting heavily on the \
inner rules. In other words, there are many different ways to grow, and so \
the ones evolution finds are not necessarily explainable. But you may be \
wondering, can we make our fitness function more restrictive, and force the \
irreducibility out of the system? \
\>", "Text",ExpressionUUID->"425beeb7-19bb-44e6-a411-76bf11a9bed7"],

Cell["\<\
Well, one common theme in biology is dealing with noise in the environment, \
and still being able to function. So we can do our same evolution, but make \
perturbations to the automaton as it grows, and take the minimum length from \
all the perturbed automaton. Then, we try to increase that minimum length. \
\>", "Text",ExpressionUUID->"74af991d-ea66-4a1a-96a7-14873a286daa"],

Cell["\<\
And the results are very nice. Because what we get are far \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]simpler\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] organisms that use \
more explainable mechanisms. \
\>", "Text",ExpressionUUID->"ac5e86f8-e9b3-4990-9d3e-6f1c85e692dd"],

Cell["\<\
So the solution that is often found is to have some pattern that ends \
despite, many of the details of the internal subpatterns:\
\>", "Text",ExpressionUUID->"e08ed15f-0fcd-445f-b2a2-7d84849d9855"],

Cell["\<\
And what we\[CloseCurlyQuote]ve touched on here is an important law of \
biology an adaptive systems, which is the more noise in the environment the \
more simple and explainable the underlying mechanisms end up being. As an \
example, animals like frogs, who are hatched from eggs in the wild, we would \
expect to have far more explainable mechanisms for how their morphogenesis \
works. But mammals who are grown mostly from the safety of the womb, wouldn\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]t have to deal with as much noise. So, I suspect that the \
embryogenesis process, especially the early stage, is far more irreducible \
and specific then something like a frog. And therefore if you mix up a human \
embryo, you\[CloseCurlyQuote]d get a completely different structure, as \
opposed to a frog / planeria embryo, who can handle these perturbations.\
\>", "Text",ExpressionUUID->"7f647612-f7c6-43d7-b236-c70d46eddc66"],

Cell["\<\
And in terms of explainability, it is known that planeria use a general \
sorting network to complete morphogenesis, and so you can perturb the system \
in the right way and get a two-headed flatworm. This would definitely not be \
possible I believe in the mammalian case.\
\>", "Text",ExpressionUUID->"ac2571e2-7d57-4754-a9f9-8edff2e64955"],

Cell["\<\
So okay, but just how reducible are these highly-robust guys? Well as we can \
see, they still have pieces of irreducibility and are not perfectly robust. \
And this is the consequence of the physical limitations of the cellular \
automaton system here, as well as the limitations of our adaptive search. \
\>", "Text",ExpressionUUID->"7dfaf1ad-3736-42c4-ab99-a65168c42c76"],

Cell["\<\
And because of this, if we take these guys outside of their noise tolerance \
level, outside of their evolved track, what we get is irreducible behavior. \
And the fundamental problem of medicine is then trying to get these guys back \
on track. \
\>", "Text",ExpressionUUID->"1f100cad-5b16-45c0-99c4-3f0e1dac1541"],

Cell["\<\
And so what has happened in most diseases, is something has happened to the \
evolved guard rails of irreducibility. But the implication is that quite \
often you can steal ideas from biology, and just apply them in a new way:\
\>", "Text",ExpressionUUID->"e800ca22-7ec5-4b5e-9777-16baa5f3033f"],

But even this still has irreducibility in it, and is computationally and \
therefore economically expensive.\

Cell["\<\
We should pause here to look at some actual medicine data. And what we see is \
that actually most of the diseases are self-inflicted! And then we spend all \
this computational effort to try to pick up the pieces. So our model would \
suggest that we should focus on simply not throwing ourselves off the cliffs \
of irreducibility. \

What we\[CloseCurlyQuote]re doing is the equivalent of the following: We have \
an evolved track that we can walk down the mountain. But instead we just jump \
off the cliff and then spend a bunch of money and time trying to building \

inhibition in mammalian systems, I suspect is much more like our irreducible \
population, where the method for growth inhibition is a complex interplay \
between different genes. This is again because mammalian morhpology is much \
more of a one-to-one function, so the guard rails on irreducibiliity are less \
